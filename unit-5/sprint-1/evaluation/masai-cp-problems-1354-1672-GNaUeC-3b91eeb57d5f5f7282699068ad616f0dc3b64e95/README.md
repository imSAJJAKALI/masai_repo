# React Custom Hook Generic Component

#### Testing Objectives for Students

1. The user should be able to create his own custom hooks, that cover most of the edge cases, related to its functionality.
2. The user should be able to use "PropTypes" for type-checking the props that the component receives.
3. The user should be able to create his own custom React components. The components should function properly when the user passes the required props.

## Boilerplate

- You are given these Components:
  - App
    - UserCard
    - Input

## Description

#### useDarkMode hook

- import the useDarkMode hook, to be used in the App.js file
- Syntax:

```JavaScript
 const [isDarkMode, toggleDarkMode] = useDarkMode();
```

- The variable isDarkMode should return false, by default
- The variable toggleDarkMode will be a function that toggles the value of isDarkMode.
- Change the UI, by using the 'dark-mode' className on app-component, by validating it with isDarkMode variable.
- Change the text on the button to Dark and Light, depending on the value of isDarkMode variable.
- For example: if isDarkMode = false, button text = 'Dark', else 'Light'
- Try persisting the theme of the application, even with page reload.
- **[HINT]**: use Local Storage

#### UserCard

- It should take the props, `imageURL`, `avatarShape`, `name`, `description`, `backgroundColor` and `title`
- Define the correct propTypes for this props, with the name prop as `isRequired`.
- avatarShape
  - values that it can take: `round` and `square`
  - default value `round`
  - use the values as classNames for making the changes.
- description
  - default value `Testing Description`
- backgroundColor
  - default value `red`
  - use the values as classnames for making the changes.

#### Input

- It should take the following props, `type`, `size`, `variant`, `value` and `onChange`.
- Define the correct propTypes for this props, with the variant prop as `isRequired`
- `type` is type of inputbox. default type is text
- size will have following values: sm, md, lg, xl. Use it as classnames. You can decide what these values for sizes going to be. Default value `md`
- variant has following values: outline, filled, and flushed. Use these values as classnames. Reference: [docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/form/input#changing-the-appearance-of-the-input)
- `value` prop will take the default value of the input tag, if any.
- `onChange` is also a callback that directly gives you value. it doesn't give entire event object, only the value we are typing. For example: [Link](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/input/usage#controlled-input)
- Show the user input text in the App.js file, inside the `input-value` div.

## Important Instructions:

- Do not remove the `data-testid` attributes from the boilerplate anywhere. Removing them may lead to low scores
- Do not remove the classNames present on the tags, they are required for the UI.
- DO NOT use CHAKRA UI.
- DO NOT use inline style.

### General Instructions

- the system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not to just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
