## Problem Statement

There is a todo app already created. There might be something missing or some mistakes in the code.
Your task is to debug the code and pass all the tests.

#### How to do this?

- Run the test command
- Refer the errors in the console
- Refer the test file and the test cases written there
- Do the required changes in the code and submit

## Note:-

DO NOT try to change anything in the test file, or it will result to ZERO mark.

## Important Instructions:

- Do not remove the `data-testid` attributes from the boilerplate anywhere. Removing them may lead to low scores
- Do not remove the class names present on the tags, they are required for the UI.
- The `options`, `type`, `name`, `tags`, etc mentioned above are CASE-SENSITIVE. So ensure to use them in the same format, as given above.

### General Instructions

- the system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,
- so we request you to read the problem carefully and debug it before itself
- we also request you not to just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
