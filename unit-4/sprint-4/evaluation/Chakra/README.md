### Problem

Create a chakra ui simple BMI Calculator which uses below mentioned chakra ui components.

**Note** - `Make sure you use only the given components and dont create new files and folders. Changing component name, structures might result in giving you zero marks.`

## Features to build

1. Create a react application for BMI Calculator using chakra ui components like

Button,
Flex,
Container,
SimpleGrid,
Center,
Grid,
Box,
Stack,
Text,
Heading
```

2. Show application name `BMI Calculator` inside `Heading` Tag

3. Create two button `Calculate` and `Reset` (case sensitive text)

4. Inside `SimpleGrid` create two input with `type - number` for weight and height

5. SimpleGrid should have class `bmi-form`

6. weight input should have class `weight` and height input should have class `height`

7. Grid should have class name `bmi-result`.Show result inside `Grid` with class `bmi-value` and `bmi-status` in `Text` Tag and will be fixed 2 digits after point (Hint : use toFixed())

8. Show `bmi-status` shown as per result and `Text` color should be as below

   ```
   height should converted into meter height = Number(height) / 100
   bmiValue = weightValue / (heightValue * heightValue);

   bmi < 18.5 - Underweight - "blue"
   bmi >=18.5 and < 25 - Healthy" - "green"
