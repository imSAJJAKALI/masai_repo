    - it should be in tabular format
    - on clicking brand here you should be able to be redirected to the `/products/<id>` page
  - SingleProductPage
    - you need to use dynamic routing to fetch the id and fetch from details from API again
  - AllRoutes
    - all the routes are present here

  - ProductCard
    - accept the following props:

- Don't change/override package.json
- please make sure you do not push package-lock.json
- You can use the codesandbox link, but please note the test cases will not work on codesandbox ( as codesandbox will not support the version for testing )
  - If you are using codesandbox, you still need to
  - download the project
  - add to your masai-course repo
  - submit the github link on the cp.masaichool.com platform

```
npm install --engine-strict

// test locally
npm run test
```

- the system on cp.masaischool.com may take between 1-20 minutes for responding,

- we also request you to not to just submit it last minute
- try to keep one submission at a time
